Thank you for visiting my website! I assume you are here because you want to know a little bit more about me! 

I am an ecologist. I ask and answer questions about why the natural world behaves the way it does. In my effort to do this, I am especially interested in leveraging diverse statistical tools. While completing a professional Masters degree in Conservation Biology, I unearthed an enthusiasm for quantitative analysis and coding in R. I’ve devoted much of my time since the discovery of this passion to cultivating my quantitative and coding skillsets. It is this passion which led me to pursue my PhD under Dr. Brice Semmens at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In addition to my quantitative pursuits, I enjoy getting into the field, and spent a good portion of my PhD driving boats, catching fish, and diving in search of acoustic receivers in the La Jolla kelp forest. 

I suspect the landmarks that marked the beginning of my path to becoming an ecologist are similar to many others in the field. I was an inquisitive child with a deep love for the outdoors and animals. Some of my most vivid childhood memories are of my summers spent hiking and fishing with my family in Colorado. However, there are other landmarks that I suspect are a little more unique. I am the child of a petroleum engineer whose job took us abroad when I was four years old. I grew up in Pakistan, Malaysia, Qatar, the UAE, and Texas, and spent almost every break from school traveling the world with my family. I drove the Karakoram Highway, sailed the Aegean Sea, rode a horse around the pyramids, and much more—all before I was sixteen. I bring this up not to gloat, but to point out that these early experiences gifted me with a different perspective and worldview than most other folks I meet. Out of necessity, I learned to be highly adaptable and open-minded. These are skills that I bring to everything I do, but I have found them to be especially useful as I have waded into the waters of field ecology and conservation. 

When I am not working on my research, I enjoy traveling, gardening, hosting BBQs, skateboarding, and surfing with my husband. I have also recently become interested in mixology, and am frequently experimenting with different cocktail recipes.
