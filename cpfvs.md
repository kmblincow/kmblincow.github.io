Climate change is altering fundamental characteristics of marine systems. Although these shifts are likely to impact fisheries, the specific changes they bring about are less clear. Fisheries constitute extremely complex social-ecological systems, which makes predicting their responses to climate change difficult. Gaining insight into the underlying dynamics of these systems can help us understand how warming oceans are likely to impact them. Using landings data from a multispecies recreational fishery in southern California, we were able to construct networks of causal interactions between species landings that demonstrate that such interactions within the fishery will likely become more complex with warming sea surface temperatures. This has management implications in that efforts to shift the landings of one species will likely have cascading effects on landings of other species targeted by the fishery.
