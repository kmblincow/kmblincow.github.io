Climate change is altering fundamental characteristics of marine systems, such as oxygen concentrations and sea surface temperature. Although these shifts are likely to impact fisheries, the specific changes they bring about are less clear. Fisheries constitute extremely complex social-ecological systems, which makes predicting their responses to climate change difficult. Gaining insight into the underlying dynamics of these systems can help us understand how warming oceans are likely to impact them. Using landings data from a multispecies recreational fishery in southern California, we were able to show that it is possible to construct networks of causal interactions between species landings which can help characterize this fishery system’s response to regional warming.

**Methods**

We used an empirical dynamic modelling (EDM) approach to build causal interaction networks of species landings from the southern California Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) fleet under different sea surface temperature conditions (anomalously cool, “normal”, and anomalously warm). You can learn more about how to use EDM approaches to uncover causal interactions in dynamic systems by watching these [videos]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-SSmlAMhY3bnogGTe2tf7hpWpl508pZZ).

**Results**

We found that there were causal interactions between species landings for every temperature classification. Under anomalously warm sea surface temperature conditions similar to what we might expect given regional climate model predictions, we found that the species landings network became more complex and inter-connected relative to anomalously cool and normal temperature periods. 

**Conclusions**

Given the context of our multispecies fishery, we assert that the increased connectivity under anomalously warm periods will pose a challenge to fisheries management in the future due to the cascading effects of single species management throughout the network of targeted species. In other words, because the landings of different species are so connected in this system, imposing single species management actions on one target species will likely influence the landings of all the other species targeted by this fishery. This suggests that efficient fisheries management in a warming ocean will increasingly require expansion to multispecies and ecosystem based management approaches.
