Giant Sea Bass (*Stereolepis gigas*) are the largest bony fish in the kelp forests of Southern California. After suffering severe population declines due to overfishing, they were protected, and are now showing signs of recovery. La Jolla is home to at least one historic Giant Sea Bass spawning site and a vibrant kelp forest community, parts of which are encompassed by two separate marine protected areas (MPAs). This makes La Jolla the ideal place to conduct a study of the spatial ecology of Giant Sea Bass. The goal of this study is to track Giant Sea Bass in La Jolla to answer the following questions: “Where do local GSBs spend their time?”, “How far do they travel?”, “To what extent do existing MPAs overlap with their ranges?”, and “Is it possible to identify a spawning aggregation in La Jolla?”. 

To address these questions I am tagging Giant Sea Bass caught in La Jolla with surgically implanted acoustic transmitters (V16-4x, VEMCO LTD). These transmitters have a lifetime of approximately 3 years, and can be detected by the existing acoustic receiver array of 30 receivers in La Jolla that I maintain. In addition, I collaborate with a Southern California Bight-wide network of >140 receivers, which will allow me to track my fish should they travel beyond the scope of my local array. My tagging effort is gathering presence data for individual fish over a time scale longer than any previous study of this species. The findings from this study will provide valuable information that can be used to promote continued conservation of this important species, and inform further inquiries about their spatial ecology, as well as the broader La Jolla kelp forest community.
