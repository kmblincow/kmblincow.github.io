Listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN due to overfishing in the first half of the 20th century, Giant Sea Bass (*Stereolepis gigas*) appear to be showing signs of recovery. Giant Sea Bass are high-level generalist predators, and are generally thought to forage in the kelp forest. Serving in this role, the return of Giant Sea Bass is likely to influence kelp forest trophic dynamics. To begin to understand these implications, we first need a deeper understanding of the trophic ecology of Giant Sea Bass. As part of an ongoing study we are leveraging stable isotope and gut content analyses to contribute to this understanding.

**Preliminary Results**

Bulk stable isotope results showed no significant relationship between δ^15 N and fish size, location, or time of capture (year or season). We found a significant relationship between δ^13 C and fish size, but no relationship with location or time of capture (year or season). Using a Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to parse apart basal carbon sources by fish size, we found that Giant Sea Bass of all sizes rely heavily on macroalgal-derived carbon sources, but smaller individuals derive ~25% of their carbon from phytoplankton sources. Gut contents are limited, because of difficulties obtaining stomachs for a protected species. Initial results suggest that most Giant Sea Bass prey are benthic organisms that reside in kelp forest and adjacent sandy bottom habitats.

**Conclusions**

Giant Sea Bass trophic ecology is more nuanced than initially thought. The differences in basal carbon sources with size could be indicative of spatial partitioning of foraging locations or ontogenetic shifts in prey. Pairing results from initial gut content analyses with reports in the literature, it is likely that larger individuals shift to more nearshore-associated prey items over time. Gut contents also suggest that Giant Sea Bass frequently forage outside of the kelp forest environments, with a large portion of their diet being made up of sand-associated prey.

**Next Steps**

We are currently performing compound specific stable isotope analysis to better resolve our understanding of δ^15 N and the trophic position of Giant Sea Bass.
