**USVI Mesophotic Lionfish**  
The invasion of Indo-Pacific lionfish (*Pterois volitans*) in the western Atlantic is one of the most extreme examples of predatory fish invasions. The spread of this species to mesophotic reefs is potentially expanding their negative impacts in the Caribbean. Dr. Rick Nemeth and collaborators tagged lionfish on mesophotic reefs throughout the USVI. By combining this movement data with territory-wide monitoring of fish communities, we demonstrated that lionfish are more abundant on mesophotic reefs compared to shallower areas, they are resident in these deeper areas, and their activity patterns sometimes deviate from the crepuscular characterization of their shallow-water counterparts.

**Biofouling Monitoring**  
Biofouling communities can serve as sentinels for the introduction of invasive species as they are often the first habitats to be invaded. As the principal investigator for the [Smithsonian's MarineGEO network](https://marinegeo.si.edu/) USVI station, I have begun monitoring biofouling communities on docks on St. Thomas. Beginning in 2025, this monitoring effort served as the basis of UVI's Master's of Marine and Environmental Science first year capstone project. The cohort of students from that year are currently working on preparing their findings for publication.  

**Other Collaborations**  
I participated in a collaborative effort to conduct an invasive species horizon scan of Puerto Rico and the USVI. Led by the USGS and USFWS along with a large number of university-based collaborators, this was a part of the National Early Detection and Rapid Response Framework. My role was to evaluate marine fish and invertebrate species based on their life history characteristics and potential vectors of introduction to determine their risk of invasion.
