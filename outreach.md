My motivation for engaging in outreach is two-fold. First, I am deeply invested in diversifying STEM fields, and encouraging students to re-imagine what a scientist looks like so that all young people can see science as a potential career path. Second, as an applied ecologist with an interest in conservation, translating science to an accessible format for the public is critical for gaining support for conservation initiatives I am passionate about.
