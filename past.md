**Giant Sea Bass (*Stereolepis gigas*)**  
Giant Sea Bass are the largest bony fish in the kelp forests of southern California. After suffering severe population declines due to overfishing, they were protected, and are now showing signs of recovery. During my PhD, I studied the trophic and movement ecology of these fish using stable isotope analysis and acoustic telemetry.

**Multispecies Recreational Fisheries**  
Fisheries constitute extremely complex social-ecological systems, which makes predicting their responses to climate change difficult. Using landings data from a multispecies recreational fishery in southern California, we constructed networks of causal interactions between species landings that demonstrate that such interactions within the fishery will likely become more complex with warming sea surface temperatures.

**Seafood Trade**  
Growth in the volume and complexity of global seafood trade has created an increasing disconnect between the sustainability of a countryâ€™s seafood production and their seafood consumption. In this study we explore differences between country-specific sustainability of produced versus consumed seafood, finding that some of the most sustainable producers are simultaneously consumers of some of the least sustainable seafood as a result of trade. Addressing the widening gap between the sustainability of seafood production and consumption demands tracing programs that can track products across the increasingly complex chains of custody leading to the tables of consumers.
