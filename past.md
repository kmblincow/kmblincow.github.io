**Giant Sea Bass (*Stereolepis gigas*)**  
Giant Sea Bass are the largest bony fish in the kelp forests of southern California. After suffering severe population declines due to overfishing, they were protected, and are now showing signs of recovery. During my PhD, I studied the trophic and movement ecology of these fish using stable isotope analysis and acoustic telemetry.

**CPFV Landings**
Fisheries constitute extremely complex social-ecological systems, which makes predicting their responses to climate change difficult. Gaining insight into the underlying dynamics of these systems can help us understand how warming oceans are likely to impact them. Using landings data from a multispecies recreational fishery in southern California, we were able to construct networks of causal interactions between species landings that demonstrate that such interactions within the fishery will likely become more complex with warming sea surface temperatures. This has management implications in that efforts to shift the landings of one species will likely have cascading effects on landings of other species targeted by the fishery.

**Seafood Trade**
A country’s seafood sustainability is often defined by how it manages fisheries stocks. However, growth in the volume and complexity of global seafood trade has created an increasing disconnect between the sustainability of a country’s seafood production and their seafood consumption. In this study we explore differences between country-specific sustainability of produced versus consumed seafood, finding that some of the most sustainable producers (e.g. the United States) are simultaneously consumers of some of the least sustainable seafood as a result of trade. This study highlights the fact that addressing the widening gap between the sustainability of seafood production and consumption demands tracing programs that can track products across the increasingly complex chains of custody leading to the tables of consumers.
