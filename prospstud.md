**Interested in Joining My Lab?**  
I am in the process of building my lab at UVI, and am open to hearing from prospective undergraduate and [MMES](https://www.uvi.edu/academics/science-math/departments/bio-sciences/marine-envir-science/masters-marine-envir/) graduate students*. My vision for my lab is that it will be an inclusive environment that fosters creative thinking, encourages the use of quantitative approaches in marine ecology research, and values work-life balance. As a mentor, I am committed to supporting my students in achieving their goals, whatever they may be. In turn, I expect my students to work hard, be open to learning new things, and be respectful of the community we are building.

If you think this sounds like something you would like to be involved with, please send me an email with your broad research interests, a potential project idea, and your CV at kayla.israel@uvi.edu.
  
**Important Note:*
While I have the ability to take on MMES students, as a new faculty member I have limited funding to support graduate students. I encourage anyone that is interested in working with me to seek their own funding sources and/or to reach out to Sophia McKenzie at sophia.mckenzie@uvi.edu to learn about funding opportunities within MMES.
