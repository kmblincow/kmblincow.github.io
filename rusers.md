Since beginning my PhD I have been an active member of Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s (SIO) R Users Group. In 2018, I took on the main leadership role. Consisting of students, faculty, and staff from SIO and NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center, our group meets weekly during the academic year to discuss different topics related to coding in R, including data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques. Our goal is to create an inclusive and welcoming community for R Users at all levels to meet fellow coders, get support when needed, and share resources. In addition to our regular meetings we also facilitate working groups and beginner coding boot camps. 
Materials from our meetings are stored on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/R-Users-Presentations) site.
