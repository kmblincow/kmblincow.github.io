Throughout my PhD I was an active member of Scripps Institution of Oceanographyâ€™s R Users Group. I found this community to be critical in developing my coding knowledge as a student, and as a result decided to bring the concept with me to the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI). Our group meets weekly during the academic year to discuss different topics related to coding in R, including data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques. Our goal is to create an inclusive and welcoming community for R Users at all levels to meet fellow coders, get support when needed, and share resources. In addition to our regular meetings we also facilitate working groups and beginner coding boot camps.   

If you are at UVI and are interested in joining the R Users Group, please email me at kayla.israel@uvi.edu!
