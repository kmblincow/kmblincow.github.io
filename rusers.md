As a proud R nerd with a genuine love for data science, I make a point to incoporate both into most of my work, whether that's teaching or research.  

**UVI R Users Group**  
I was an active member of an R Users Group as a graduate student and found the community to be critical in developing my coding knowledge. I brought the concept with me to the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) and established an R Users Groups here as well. We meet weekly during the academic year to discuss topics related to coding in R. Our goal is to create an inclusive and welcoming community for R Users at all levels to meet fellow coders, get support when needed, and share resources. In addition to our regular meetings we also facilitate working groups and beginner coding boot camps.   

If you are at UVI and are interested in joining the R Users Group, please email me at kayla.israel@uvi.edu!  

**UVI Data Science Program**  
UVI has a burgeoning [data science program](https://www.uvi.edu/academics/programs/data-science.html), including options for a professional certificate and a minor in data science. I teach the program's Intro to Data Science course and develop R and Python learning modules that can be implemented across the program's curriculum.  

**R & Data Science Workshops**  
UVI has a number of programs geared towards building research capacity among undergraduates, including the [Emerging Caribbean Scientists program](https://www.uvi.edu/research/emerging-caribbean-scientists-programs/index.html). I have developed and regularly facilitate data science-focused short-form workshops for students involved in these programs to build their data literacy and visualization skills.
