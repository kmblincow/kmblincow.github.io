I advise students in UVI's Master of Marine and Environmental Science (MMES) program in multiple capacities, including as a main advisor, committee member, and providing general statistical expertise.

*Miranda Goad*  
Miranda was born and raised on St. Thomas. She completed her Bachelor of Science degree in Marine Biology at UVI where she engaged in research related to mangroves and sandy shores. As a master's student she is collaborating with Bryan Legare from the [Center for Coastal Studies](https://coastalstudies.org/) to research juvenile sharks in the USVI. Using longline surveys and acoustic telemetry, she intends to identify nursery habitats and characterize juvenile shark behavior across different bays on St. Thomas and St. John.

*Stefanie Maxin*  
Stef is originally from Texas where she graduated with a degree in Marine and Freshwater Science from the University of Texas in Austin. Her masterâ€™s research focused on utilizing passive acoustic data to learn more about fish ecology. In particular, she quantified Nassau grouper vocalizations at a local spawning aggregation to better understand their ongoing recovery in the US Virgin Islands. She also identified and documented a passive sound produced by yellowtail parrotfish during their spawning activities which is being used as a metric to measure differences in spawning behavior under varying environmental conditions. She is currently working on analyzing passive acoustic data collected from multiple species in the USVI.
