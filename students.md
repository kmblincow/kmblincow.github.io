*Stefanie Maxin*  
Stef is originally from Texas where she graduated with a degree in Marine and Freshwater Science from the University of Texas in Austin. Her masterâ€™s research focused on utilizing passive acoustic data to learn more about fish ecology. In particular, she quantified Nassau grouper vocalizations at a local spawning aggregation to better understand their ongoing recovery in the US Virgin Islands. She also identified and documented a passive sound produced by yellowtail parrotfish during their spawning activities which is being used as a metric to measure differences in spawning behavior under varying environmental conditions. She is currently working on analyzing passive acoustic data collected from multiple species in the USVI.
