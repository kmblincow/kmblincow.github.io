*Stefanie Maxin*  
  
Stef is originally from Texas where she graduated with a degree in Marine and Freshwater Science from the University of Texas in Austin. Her masterâ€™s research focuses on utilizing passive acoustic data to learn more about fish ecology. In particular, she is quantifying Nassau grouper vocalizations at a local spawning aggregation to better understand their ongoing recovery in the US Virgin Islands. She is also working to identify passive sounds produced by yellowtail parrotfish during their spawning activities which will be used as a metric to measure differences in spawning behavior under varying environmental conditions.
